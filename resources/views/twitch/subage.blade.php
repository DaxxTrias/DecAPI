            <p class="text text-info">You have successfully authenticated and can now use this to display subscriber age for a specific user in your channel using chatbots.</p>

            <p class="text text-warning">
                Please keep in mind that the subscription age <strong>might not be accurate to the subscription anniversaries</strong> posted in chat (e.g. <code>Decicus has been subscribed for 21 months in a row!</code>).
                <br>
                <br>
                This type of subscription only tracks when payment info was updated, while the anniversaries have a grace period of roughly 30 days before they expire.
                <br>
                <br>
                What this means is that if someone temporarily cancels their subscription to renew it using different payment information (e.g. their old credit/debit card expires), the subscription age will be counted from the date they re-subscribed using the new payment information.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another instance is Twitch Prime: If you have a subscriber that consistently uses their Twitch Prime to subscribe to your channel every month, <strong>the subscription age will reset every month</strong>.
                <br>
                <br>
                This message only serves as a "heads up", to make sure people know the difference.
